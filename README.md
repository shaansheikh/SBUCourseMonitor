# SBUCourseMonitor

This is a chat bot that notifies Stony Brook University students when a seat opens up in a course they want to take. This currenly works with Kik Messanger and Facebook Messenger. Note that at this time, only Kik is public and Facebook is restricted to manually approved accounts.

Watch the demo video [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B4bby8K7eEPnMExrWnZYYUw4X3c).

To try it out, send a kik message to sbucoursebot or scan the qr code.
